# React GraphQL TailwindCSS Boilerplate

This repository serves as my personal boilerplate for React projects utilizing GraphQL and TailwindCSS. It is built on top of the VITE development environment. While currently tailored for JavaScript, there may be plans to create a TypeScript version in the future.

## Features

- **React**: A popular and efficient JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing those queries by specifying your data as types and fields on those types.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **VITE**: A fast, opinionated build tool that serves as a lightning-fast development environment for your projects.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with this boilerplate:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Raphael-Soares/React-GraphQL-TailwindCSS
   ```

   ```bash
   cd React-GraphQL-TailwindCSS 
   ```

1.  Install dependencies:

    `npm install`

2.  Start the development server:


    `npm run dev`

3.  Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173` to see your application in action.

Directory Structure
-------------------

Here's a brief overview of the project structure:

-   `src/`: This is where your application's source code resides.
    -   `components/`: Place your React components here.
    -   `graphql/`: Store your GraphQL queries/mutations here.
    -   `styles/`: Customize TailwindCSS styles in this directory.
    -   `pages/`: Define your application's pages/routes here.
    -   `App.js`: The main entry point of your application.
-   `vite.config.js`: Configuration for the VITE build tool.

Customization
-------------

Feel free to customize this boilerplate to fit your project's specific needs. You can modify the TailwindCSS styles, add additional components, or integrate TypeScript if desired.

Deploying Your Project
----------------------

When you're ready to deploy your project, you can use the VITE build command to generate a production-ready build:



`npm run build`

This will create an optimized build of your application in the `dist/` directory that you can then deploy to your hosting provider of choice.
